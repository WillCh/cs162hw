The address of main (0x4005c2) is in .text, address of recur (0x40057d) is in .text as well.

The important sections are .plt (which includes the malloc), .text which includes the instructions, and .dynamic.

The stack goes to the direction 0x0, (if we set 0x0 as the top, then stack goes up).

The size of stack frame for each recursion is 48B.

The heap goes to the direction FxF, (if we set 0x0 as the top, then heap goes down).

The space malloc is not contiguous, the space between head of two buffer is 112B, not 100B.
